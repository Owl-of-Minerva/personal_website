			| In 2012, I made a facebook group <b><a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/370718849612205/">UIUC Class of 2016 - INDIA!!!</a></b>, which helped more than 100 students from India to make it to the University of Illinois. I wrote many documents answering common questions, which come to every initernational students' mind before coming to the US. I answered questions like - How to reach campus from Chicago? Which flights to take? How's life at Illinois? What to pack? How's the dorm scene like? What univeristy medical insurance covers? etc. The response from the students was so over-whelming that I continued this culture and, today, it is a part of this univeristy. So far around 300 students from India have made it to the Univeristy of Illinois (around 60 to the Department of Computer Science) using one of my facebook groups.

			| I am an active member of the Indian Red Cross Society and the Lions Club International since 2008. I have helped these organizations in many of their initiatives like <b>Sight First Campaign (2010), Rehabilitation work of Natural Calamities (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_North_India_floods">Uttrakhand Flood 2013</a>), First Aid Training Campaigns </b>etc.

			| I believe most of the challenges parts of Indian society is facing can be overcomed by educating people. In 2010, I taught mathematics to the street children at Apna School in a north Indian district named Panipat. In 2014, I launched my data structure lecture series in Hindi for the Indian programmers, so that they don't have to overcome the language barrier to order to code. Please visit my lecture series on this <a href="/lectures">website</a> and let me know how can I improve.
